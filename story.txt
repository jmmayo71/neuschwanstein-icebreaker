I once went to a biergarten and got a moldy brot, I wondered if the lady in the cute dirndel ever noticed.
I bought some new lederhose in hopes that she might.
I spilled my doener on myself when I asked her out to the Rammstein show.
She laughed, but then to my surprise, said I was as sweet as Apfelkuchen.
She told me she prefers driving a Prius instead of a BMW or Porsche.
She said she was wettbewebsfaehig and that she wanted to make a wager with me.
The wager was to see who could eat the most Bratwurst.
